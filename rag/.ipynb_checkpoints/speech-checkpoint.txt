“I Have a Dream,” delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on August 28, 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, is one of the most iconic and impactful speeches in American history.

The speech, set against the backdrop of the Lincoln Memorial, begins with King’s acknowledgment of the Emancipation Proclamation, which had freed millions of slaves a century earlier. However, he quickly points out that African Americans were still not free from segregation, discrimination, and poverty. King’s speech is a vivid portrayal of the struggles faced by Black Americans and a call for an end to racial injustice.

King employs the metaphor of a “bad check,” saying that America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.” However, he refuses to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. This metaphor underlines the broken promises made to African Americans.

Central to his speech is the famous refrain, “I have a dream,” which he uses to express his vision of a future where people will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character. He dreams of a day when his children will live in a nation where they will not be judged by their race. King’s dream extends to different aspects of life, including freedom, justice, and brotherhood.

The speech is also notable for its hopeful tone. King talks about his belief that one day, freedom and equality will be a reality in America. He urges the audience to continue to fight for a just future but to do so with dignity and discipline, avoiding physical violence.

He concludes by looking forward to a day when all Americans can join together as equals, singing the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
